# README

This code was written for the [Sortable coding challenge](https://sortable.com/challenge/). For better compatibility and support, Python 2.7.12 was used. Provided Python 2.7 is installed, the code can be run by cloning the repository into a directory and running `python classify.py` from that directory. The results will be in a file named `output.txt`.
